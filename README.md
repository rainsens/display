# Project Display System
This system is designed to store project information for all types of projects that are undertaken within the School including but not limited to student coursework projects, student coursework thesis, student research higher degree, research group projects, and academic projects. With this the people involved in the project can be student or staff members depending on the specific project.
The projects can be created and managed by members of the project as well as administrative staff. A project can store both private information that only the project team can see, and public information that is displayed in various form factors. The tool, technology and resources that the project use can be recorded – this should include resources borrow/owned by the School and those supplied by the project team.
The projects as an initial and primary way of being displayed is via a website. Nevertheless, it could be further extended to mobile app and mobile website in future because it provides a fully compatible Api implementation. A secondary but vital part is that can be displayed on screens so long as they are connected into internet. A curated list of projects to be displayed on the screens can be set up. The visual design of these displays are both appealing and informative. A tertiary way of display the projects is for a showcase such as the provided example – a curated list of invited projects that will be displaying at the event that can be shown on a website that is mobile friendly and on display screen.
